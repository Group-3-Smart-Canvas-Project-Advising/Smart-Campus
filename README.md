# Smart Campus

Currently developing with Webstorm IDE.
It isn't much, just opens a browser tab and shows a login screen. If you enter 'user' for the user
name field and 'password' for the password field, a message should appear
notifying you of a successful login and it will take you to the login success page(empty right now).
If anything else is entered into the input fields a notification saying invalid credentials should pop up.

I'm going to try and get a link setup so that we can go into 
the repository and run the app from there!

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
   git checkout 
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
   npm install
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
   npm run dev
```

5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port)

## Project Structure
