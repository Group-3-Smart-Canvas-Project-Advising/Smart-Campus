# Smart-Canvas

Primary Goal: 
A system that assesses students’ interests, strengths, and career preferences to provide tailored advising services. Backend support would be provided with an online database to provide interconnectivity across applications. The vision is to provide students with a career path that is optimized for success.  Some of the services/features we envision would be: 

 

      Elective recommendations that best fit the student’s desired path or preferences. The system could also provide recommendations for a specific professor/class that conforms         to the student’s preferred learning style. Such as visual, independent course work, group activities, more/less structured etc. 

      Optimized course selection for part-time students or students who want to fast track their degree. Automated descriptions of the time to graduation based on the student’s           desired workload. 

      Flow chart that shows the prerequisite path for each class and provides a visual depiction of the student’s anticipated degree path. 

      Detailed description of each class and the content that will be taught. This would use information from the internet or internal documents to build a clear understanding of         each class. 

      AI integration that provides notifications/reminders for course announcements and due dates. Could also act as a schedule manager so the student can determine the amount of         time to allocate and removes the need for constant monitoring of course schedules. 

      AI integration that provides tutoring information/external information to assist with the class, topic, or homework. 

      AI integration that automatically sends summary emails based on generated transcripts from any correspondence such as meetings, online classes, PowerPoints etc. This would          act like a virtual note-taking service and allow students to rapidly access information needed for their classes.
