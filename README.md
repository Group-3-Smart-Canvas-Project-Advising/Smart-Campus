# Smart Campus

I'm using the Webstorm IDE to develop this so far.
I know we haven't really discussed too many implementation details,
but I wanted to get something up and going! It isn't much, just opens
a browser tab and shows a login screen. If you enter 'user' for the user
name field and 'password' for the password field, a message should appear
notifying you of a successful login and it will take you to the login success page(empty right now).
If anything else is entered into the input fields a notification saying invalid credentials should pop up.
